## Music and Audio Generation
- [MusicGen](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/MusicGen) Music generation by prompt.
- [Bark](https://huggingface.co/spaces/suno/bark) Bark can generate highly realistic, multilingual speech as well as other audio - including music, background noise and simple sound effects.

## Text Generation
- [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com)
- [Bard](https://bard.google.com/)
- [Llama2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/llama2)
- BingChat, you found this on edge browser on screen top left section.
- [WizardCoder](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-Python-34B-V1.0) Model trained only for python code.

## Multimodal
- [Seamless M4T](https://ai.meta.com/blog/seamless-m4t/) Multimodal language model for Automatic speech recognition, Speech-to-text translation, Speech-to-speech translation, Text-to-text translation, and Text-to-speech translation.
- [ImageBind](https://imagebind.metademolab.com/demo) Model capable of binding data from six modalities at once, without the need for explicit supervision. By recognizing the relationships between these modalities â€” images and video, audio, text, depth, thermal and inertial measurement units (IMUs).
- [IDEFICS](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceM4/idefics_playground) Multimodal model that accepts arbitrary sequences of image and text inputs and produces text outputs.
